###Live Geocoding of Free Text

##Abstract
In recent years there has been a significant development in terms of geocoding and geoparsing. Almost all online 
web mapping services like Google Maps, Yahoo Maps and  Open 
Street Maps provide geocoding services, with varying degrees of accuracy. Progress has also been 
made to geoparsing techniques, since there are tools such as Yahoo Placemaker, trying to perform
geoparsing and geocoding simultaneously.

IMIS has a considerable experience on this field.  The institute has carried out  important 
research in the identification of geographic terms in  Greek and English text, while there is 
considerable know how on geocoding  services.

The scope of this thesis is to develop an AJAX web application that will use the existing 
possibilities for recognition of geographical terms in Greek and English  text in conjunction with 
online geocoding services,  in order  to identify geographical terms  in free text and  enable 
simultaneous display on the map.

##Demo
As the geoparse was an external module to geotyping, for testing purposes there is an embedded "dummy" geoparser that recognizes only 
uppercase words in free text. The two proxy files are used to circumvent the same origin policy.
